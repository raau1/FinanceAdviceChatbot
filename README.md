### How to Run the Project:

1. **Set up the MySQL Database:**
   - Create a database named `ibmhackathon`and Create a user with the username `user` and password `password`.
   - Ensure the user has permissions to access and use the database.
   

2. **Run the Project:**
   - To run the project, run the `FinanceAdviceChatbotApplication.java` file.
   

3. **Setting Up API Key:**
   - From https://huggingface.co, create an account then go to the Access Tokens page, https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Create new token with "Make calls to inference providers and endpoints" 
   - Replace in application.properties
   
    
4. **Running the Project:**
   - Once the API key is set up, the project should run successfully.
   
  
5. **Final Alternative**
   - Alternatively, https://ibm-hackathon-production.up.railway.app/ should give you access to the project
   - The styling has slightly changed from when we ran it but functionally the project should be the same
